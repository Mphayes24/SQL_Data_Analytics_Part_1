1. In the job_postings_fact table, determine the average yearly salaries (salary_year_avg) for ‘Data Scientist’ job postings, using the job_title_short column. 
Your query should return one column for the average yearly salary. Only include jobs that have a yearly salary (salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL).

SELECT 
	AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM 
	job_postings_fact
WHERE 
	salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
	AND job_title_short ='Data Scientist'; 

2. Using the job_postings_fact table find the average, minimum, and maximum salary range for each job_title_short. 
Only include job titles with more than 1,000 job postings and group data by job_title_short . 
Order by job_title_short in ascending order.

SELECT 
   job_title_short,
   AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_salary,
   MIN(salary_year_avg) AS lowest_avg_salary_offered, 
   MAX(salary_year_avg) AS highest_avg_salary_offered 
FROM 
   job_postings_fact
GROUP BY 
   job_title_short
HAVING 
   COUNT(job_id) > 1000
ORDER BY
   job_title_short;

3. In the job_postings_fact table list countries along with their average yearly salary (salary_year_avg) for job postings, where the average yearly salary exceeds $100,000. 
Group the results by job_country. Only get job postings where there is an average yearly salary included (salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL).

SELECT 
	job_country, 
	AVG(salary_year_avg) AS average_salary
FROM 
	job_postings_fact
WHERE 
	salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
	job_country
HAVING 
	AVG(salary_year_avg) > 100000;

4. In the job_postings_fact table count the number of job postings for each location (job_location) that do NOT offer remote work. 
Display the location and the count of non-remote job postings, and order the results by the count in descending order. 
Show locations where the average salary for non-remote jobs is above $70,000.

SELECT 
  job_location,
  COUNT(job_id) AS not_remote_job_count
FROM 
  job_postings_fact
WHERE 
  job_work_from_home = false
GROUP BY 
  job_location
HAVING 
  AVG(salary_year_avg) > 70000 
ORDER BY 
  not_remote_job_count DESC;
