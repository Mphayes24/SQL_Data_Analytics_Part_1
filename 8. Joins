1. Retrieve a list of job titles (job_title from the job_posting_fact table) with their corresponding company names (name from the company_dim table). 
Also, get the job_id, job_location, and job_posted_date. 
Only return job postings that have the ‘Data Scientist' as the job title (job_title_short). Order by the job posted date in descending order.

SELECT 
    job_postings_fact.job_id,
    job_postings_fact.job_title, 
    company_dim.name,
    job_postings_fact.job_location,
    job_postings_fact.job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact 
INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
ORDER BY    
    job_postings_fact.job_posted_date DESC;
    
2. Fetch all job postings, including their job_id, job_title and the names of the skills required (skills); even if no skills are listed for a job. 
Ensure that the job is located in ‘New York’ and offers health insurance. 
Use the job_postings_fact, skills_job_dim, and skills_dim tables. Order by job_id in descending order.

SELECT 
	job_postings_fact.job_id,
	job_postings_fact.job_title, 
	skills_dim.skills
FROM 
	job_postings_fact
	LEFT JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
	LEFT JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
	job_postings_fact.job_location = 'New York' 
	AND job_postings_fact.job_health_insurance = TRUE
ORDER BY job_postings_fact.job_id DESC;

3. Identify the top skills required for jobs that offer remote work and have an average yearly salary above $100,000. 
Return the skill name (skills) and the number of job postings that mention each skill, ordered by the number of job postings in descending order.

SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) AS num_job_postings
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
	INNER JOIN 
	    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
	INNER JOIN 
	    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = TRUE -- Remote work 
    AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg > 100000
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY 
    num_job_postings DESC;
